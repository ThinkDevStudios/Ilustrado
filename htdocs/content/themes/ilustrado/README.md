Ilustrado Restaurant - Theme
==========================

Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Ilustrado heartily continues a tradition of serving world-class Spanish-Filipino and Global cuisines to its discriminating patrons.

 

Serving heads of state, dignitaries and other luminaries such as the King and Queen of Spain (twice) along with local and foreign tourists, balikbayans and corporate clients allows Ilustrado to passionately promote the country’s best features – warm hospitality, wonderful food and beautiful culture.

 

Through the years, the Ilustrado brand has won a reputation for excellent cuisine and impeccable service in an exceptional destination setting at the heart of historic Intramuros in the City of Manila. Today, Ilustrado is a comforting haven for regular patrons, a beloved place for the romantics, a nostalgic venue for weddings, and a top-quality Filipino caterer for important events.
